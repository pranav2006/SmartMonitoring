# Project Rules for SmartMonitoring

## Client Cost Profile Rules
- When actual training metrics (latency/energy) are not available, default them to `0.0` instead of using theoretical cycle/frequency formulas to classify client cost profiles in `rl_env.py` and `selector.py`.

## CloudFormation Syntax Rules
- In CloudFormation YAML templates for EC2 `UserData`, use `UserData: !Base64 |` directly without inserting `Fn::Base64: !Sub |` or placing `!Sub` after it.
